# Lab 8: Data Analysis and Clustering in Python

This lab focuses on various data preprocessing, analysis, and clustering techniques using Python.

## 1. cleandata.py - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Functionality:** Loads data, assigns column names, drops unnecessary columns, and performs other preprocessing steps.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn.impute

## 2. lab8a.py - K-Means Clustering Analysis

- **Functionality:** Applies K-Means clustering with varying number of clusters, possibly includes sample selection and additional analysis.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.decomposition

## 3. lab8b.py - Correlation Analysis

- **Functionality:** Computes correlation matrix, identifies top correlations, and possibly visualizes or further analyzes these correlations.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

## 4. lab8c.py - Hierarchical Clustering Analysis

- **Functionality:** Performs hierarchical clustering using selected features, scales data, and may include dendrogram visualization.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn.cluster, scipy.cluster
